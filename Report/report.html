To be more specific, RedBytes was inspired by the Red Cross Organization combined with our teamâ€™s interest in data and information technology study. And aligning with our objective to help the medical industry, our team has begun the Loving Donor project, where we will be devoting our effort to create a website to encourage the blood donation movement in Vietnam. We have set our goal to make a digital page that will be the unifying front for all blood donation related activities of which will be dedicated for patients who are in need of blood transfusion, healthy blood donors and also professional medical practitioners. From our research, we understand that the practice of blood donating has only begun to rise in popularity in Vietnam in recent years, owing some parts to the infamous Covid-19 pandemic (Vietnam+ 2022). However, Vietnam has yet to achieve the ideal position where our people throughout the country have easy access to a safe and quality ensured blood transfusion system. Therefore, with this project, we hope to be able to make a difference in improving the health and safety of the public. </p>

                    <p>Our project, Loving Donors, is an interactive and user-friendly blood donation website. It aims to connect hospital-based organisations and potential blood donors, emphasising the importance of blood donation and its benefits.</p>
 <p>The website's home page provides comprehensive information about the donation process, eligibility requirements, and health considerations. It simplifies the registration process with an easy-to-use form, allowing donors to input personal information and update it as needed.</p>
 <p>Key features of the website include blood donation scheduling, enabling donors to book appointments online and manage them flexibly. It also helps donors find the nearest donation facility based on their location. After each donation, the website assesses the donor's health and provides examination results for monitoring purposes. This helps hospitals manage their blood supply efficiently and plan future campaigns. Donors can track their donation history and milestones, fostering engagement.</p>
 <p>Data analysis features to collect and analyse demographic and donation information, helping hospitals assess campaign efficiency and manage blood sources effectively. The website integrates with social media, sharing inspiring donor stories to encourage visitors. Contact information and support features are provided for donor inquiries.</p>
 <p>Overall, our project aims to promote blood donation, raise awareness, and provide a user-friendly platform for donors. By optimising the donation process and utilising data analysis, we aim to increase donation rates, optimise blood resources, and save lives.</p>

                            familiarize ourselves with the basic concepts.
                            Fortunately, Phuong is an expert in this field, and

                            knowledge to avoid difficulties. For example, An
                            would focus on learning how to make a login page,
                            and Nghia and Triet will study a lot about CSS to

                <p class="w-100">As mentioned in the project limitation, our website has postponed the data analysis and visualisation functions for later  due to our insufficient experience and knowledge. However, in the case where this web project is given the opportunity for investment and further development, the next step of expansion would be to include an API integration for data analysis. This development stage will be much more technical compared to the work that we have done so far, therefore, the team will need to hire qualified personnel to aid in the formal development process. Some of the features that the project should complete in this development plan are to design a data collection and scraping process, build a data processing architecture, integrate analysis modules to the system, testing and revision, etc. Forecasting a six-month development period for the mentioned features, we hope to assemble a team of professionals from specific specialties to handle the major technicalities required for the advanced features. This would be a team of four, of which consists of a project manager, a data analysis, a back-end developer and a quality tester.
                  
                
                 
                  </p>
                  <p class=" "><strong>Project manager: </strong>
                    As the complexity level of the project grows in the upcoming development stages, it would be a correct decision to have a project manager overseeing the further developments. This position will be the first recruitment decision for the project, as having a project manager on board will introduce a higher level of professionalism and work proficiency to the team via their expertise in regulating the team resource and keep progress moving on schedule. By definition, a project manager is responsible for organising and monitoring a project as well as making sure results are completed within scope and delivered on time without going over the allotted budget (Nieto-Rodriguez & Khelifi 2021). For our project, they will be acting as a leader for the new team of four that will be carrying out the new development in a period of six months. They are expected to be handling the planning phase which includes identifying the key stakeholders who will be affected by the new features and understanding the implementation objectives to design high-level scopes, deadlines, risks, etc. And during the execution stages, the project manager should be overseeing the progress and maintaining a positive progressive environment for the team members to help everyone successfully complete their assigned tasks. Thus, the project manager that we hope to recruit should be able to demonstrate the necessary skills required for their position, of which are (PMI 2023):
                    Leadership and Effective Communication: a project manager must have the ability to pilot and communicate with their team and also stakeholders effectively.
                    Planning and Time Management: to efficiently delegate tasks to suitable personals and to ensure project artefacts are delivered on time. 
                    Adaptability and Innovative Problem Solving: a project manager must be able to solve and adapt to obstacles and arising issues to ensure timely progress and quick recovery from losses. 
                    Motivation and Team Management: to ensure high morality for team members while they work on the project, to solve any problem that might arise within the teamâ€™s dynamic and to guarantee quality results.
                    </p>
                    <p class="">  <strong>Data Analyst: </strong>
                      As discussed earlier in our goals for the Loving Donor project, we hope to integrate data study into the blood donation process to find useful insights that can improve blood donation, storage and transportation processes. To be more specific, we want to discover the hidden patterns in data that may enable us to make informative decisions to prevent unfortunate events such as blood bank shortage. Our team requires the skills of a data analyst because, aside from the data calculation that they can provide, they have the ability to combine both the study result with the data to provide comprehensible illustrations for our users and stakeholders. The reason for this decision is rooted in our goal to provide the best user experience for our donors so by having to actually see how their donation could positively impact the bigger interest of the public and also for medical institutions to forecast future scenarios where a scarcity in donated blood might occur. A data analyst in our team will bear the responsibility of collecting, structuring and interpreting data to find the insight for a hypothesis that they formulate based on the request of users and stakeholders (Gagnon 2022). Therefore, aside from having the ability to work with data and be familiar with the various data analysis tools such as R, Python, SQL, they also need to be able to interpret and communicate their findings with everyone (Coursera 2023).
                      </p>
                      <p class="">
                        <strong>Back-end Developer: </strong>
                        As of the submission date of this report, the current development stage of our website has only been limited to the front-end construction. Therefore, to further the completion of our project, our team would need to hire a back-end developer to handle the databases, create APIs and set up our servers. The back-end developer on our team will be working on tasks such as (Deshpande 2023):
                        Developing and maintaining APIs and systems.
                        Finalising and securing databases.
                        Optimising application for performance and scalability.
                        Write programs and create test suites for quality assurance.
                        For them to be able to complete these tasks, our team will be looking for a back-end developer that has a quality background in computer science and web design; they must be familiar with AWS technology development and also be able to create secure applications. And finally, they must be resourceful with their job, being flexible with the assigned tasks and able to work through obstacles using their creativity (SII 2023).
                        </p><p class=""> <strong>Quality Assurance Tester: </strong>
                          Through recruiting a tester, we will be able to ensure the usability and quality level of our website before releasing it to the public. As our team does not have sufficient experience and knowledge in creating a professional product, having a tester in our team will make up for our inexperience as they will have to follow a formal procedure to test every possibility of the product and generate a comprehensive report on the quality of the website for revision and correction. The quality assurance tester is essential for our website to reach the proper functioning level before launch as they will evaluate the current system and new implementation to look for any possible problems and help improve the overall user experience of our website (Burns 2019). For our website, the tester is expected to review and implement a systematic testing procedure with a structure consisting of the following tasks (Indeed 2023):
                          Design test suites for various circumstances.
                          Document and evaluate results.
                          Identify and report bugs and glitches.
                          Detect and isolate errors and failures.
                          Review user interfaces and feedback.
                            For this project, we want to hire a quality assurance tester that is proficient in testing software, knowledgeable with programming languages to handle to technical testing aspects; they should also have a keen sense of attention to details and have good analytical skills to be able to examine the testing results; and finally they should also have a decent degree in soft skills to able to communicate with the rest of the team.</p>

                 After working with the group, I myself have learned many
                 things and understood more about the members. I believe one of
                 the things we do well is communication. This is one of those
                 rare times when it comes to teamwork, it's a disagreement of
                 opinion, our team respects each other's opinions and when we
                 decide on an issue, we accept it. as well as improve and make
                 it the best. Besides, our team has reasonable working time,
                 which leads to quite effective work performance. However,
                 there are bound to be limitations, I believe one of them is
                 time management. From the beginning, most people wanted to get
                 it done as soon as possible, but when we realized that the
                 deadline had come, we didn't meet the deadline the team set
                 itself. Even so, I firmly believe that this is a good point as
                 it is quite easy to improve. The fact that there was no
                 internal quarrel was quite a surprise for me, but the most
                 surprising thing was that 2 out of 4 members of the group were
                 infected with Covid-19. But despite the limitations on health,
                 the team can still manage and do well in the work they
                 undertake. This has really given me a lot of experience in
                 handling unexpected situations, besides, I believe I have
                 learned a lot about presentation skills, especially the
                 synchronization between speech and actions leading to the
                 delivery of the highest quality content.

               <p>
                 Although I am not an experienced or the oldest member, I have
                 been assigned the role of project manager and developer.
                 Initially, I was surprised by the opportunity to become a
                 project manager. It is indeed a challenging role, but with my
                 own efforts and the support I received, I find this job
                 interesting and meaningful. I started my work by understanding
                 the strengths and weaknesses of each team member through
                 conversations. I always strive to create a dynamic and
                 positive environment where team members are not restricted and
                 can leverage their strengths. As a project manager, I always
                 provide clear task assignments and deadlines for each team
                 member, aiming to ensure that goals are completed on time and
                 not to delay the group's progress. However, I have been too
                 strict in controlling the project, which has made people feel
                 demotivated when working with me. The climax was when two out
                 of four members fell ill during the project. I was shocked
                 when I heard the news, but after calming down, I realized that
                 I should not put too much work pressure on everyone. It would
                 be better if I could balance the work and personal lives of
                 the team members. Additionally, I am also responsible for the
                 development website as a developer. I was extremely surprised
                 that Phuong, despite being a first-year student, had a solid
                 foundation in website design, helping me familiarize myself
                 with new concepts like frontend (FE), backend (BE), and user
                 interface/user experience (UI/UX). After working with the team
                 for a while, I learned that it can be very beneficial to let
                 team members shine in their respective fields. On the other
                 hand, a strict leadership style can sometimes limit creativity
                 and performance. Most importantly, the team becomes strongest
                 when members support and help each other, working together to
                 grow and develop.

               <p>
                 To be able to participate and work on this assignment has been
                 a very valuable learning experience for myself, to be more
                 specific, I was to gain a great deal of knowledge in website
                 development and IT market insights. Over the period of this
                 assignment, we have encountered numerous obstacles such as
                 myself and another team member getting sick because we
                 contracted the Covid-19 virus and busy schedules. But our team
                 was able to overcome these challenges, thanks to An, who took
                 up the role as the project manager, with his ability to
                 quickly respond to sudden development to formulate the
                 appropriate response. However, from my perspective, I believe
                 that there is one shortcoming that we should address which is
                 the project and planning stage. It is likely due to the fact
                 that our team is relatively new to the formal procedure of
                 producing a functioning website so there were some hiccups
                 when it came to the execution process. So for future
                 endeavors, I firmly believe that the correct decision on how
                 we should approach a new and difficult project is to do
                 extensive research on how we should work as a team to tackle
                 the technical aspects of a job. In this project, I was fondly
                 surprised that our team has a very good dynamic when working
                 with each other: everyone accommodates each other's needs,
                 there are rarely any arguments and, if there arise opposing
                 ideas, we always try to find the middle ground that all team
                 members are satisfied with. In the course of working on this
                 assignment with my team, one of the more valuable lessons that
                 I was able to learn was that everyone must play to their
                 strength in order for the group to be successful. As our team
                 leader, An, who was very considerate of everyone, delegated
                 work to us according to our strength and affinity with the
                 task. So even with the mishaps that we have faced along the
                 way, our team was still able to make it out on top of the most
                 challenging situation.

                 Firstly, it was great to say that expectations for team
                 collaboration were met, with responsible and efficient work
                 under time pressure. We communicated effectively and supported
                 each other throughout the project. However, there is still
                 room for improvement. Some members struggled to work on their
                 own and be independent, though this was a minor issue as we
                 continuously reminded and pushed others to do good work. I
                 hope implementing a stricter policy on deadlines and also
                 punishments could address this. Additionally, it took time for
                 some members to familiarize themselves with the required tools
                 like HTML, CSS, and GitHub, so we wish to have better guidance
                 and materials that would streamline the development process
                 better. Surprisingly, specific tasks took longer than
                 expected, directly affecting our timelines and introducing
                 conflicts to external events and other ongoing assignments.
                 Recognizing this, I'll start accounting for potential delays
                 for future projects. This group experience also taught me the
                 importance of recognizing and leveraging individual strengths.
                 Triet's data analysis expertise, An's responsible leadership,
                 and Nghia's hardworking nature were valuable contributions. To
                 sum up, our team has done well considering the pressure and
                 the high expectation of the project. Addressing issues with
                 deadlines, planning for unexpected delays, and providing
                 better documentation and guidance for the basics will help us
                 improve in the long run. On top of that, recognizing and
                 utilizing individual strengths is vital to success.

                 <h4>Group Reflection</h4>
               <p>Overall, throughout the 12 weeks of studying the Essentials of Information Technology course, our team of four membersâ€”An, Phuong, Nghia, and Trietâ€”had the opportunity to interact and work effectively together. Initially, we thought that working as a team would be challenging since none of us knew each other before, but we were pleasantly surprised to find that the process went smoothly and all team members collaborated exceptionally well. It can be said that each member was dedicated and enthusiastic about both the group work and the assigned tasks.




                 <p>Our first group assignment arrived early, and since we had limited experience in project execution, each member would read the assignment requirements first and then meet to discuss and determine the project's direction, along with specific responsibilities for each individual. But, this became our working process for the next assignment, with a few changes from online meetings on platforms like messaging apps, and Google Meet, and ultimately decided to conduct our meetings on Teams due to its superior features and the ability to store meeting information. Each member's tasks also changed throughout the assessments, where An initially took on the role of Project Manager, responsible for managing the completion process and deadlines, followed by Phuong as the Technical Leader in order to assist An's role. While each member held a different position and had distinct responsibilities, we always strived to provide feedback and review each other's work. This not only improved the quality of our assignments but also strengthened our bond as a team.</p>
                
                
                <p> In terms of document storage, we utilized Google Drive and Google Docs, while code was done on Visual Studio Code and GitHub. As for communication, we used Facebook Messenger and Team online meeting room as a means of contact. The aforementioned tools undoubtedly contributed significantly to the convenience and effectiveness of group work. Although it cannot be denied that working as a team could be challenging at times, especially when Triet and Nghia faced a fever during tight deadlines, our team always showed understanding and supported each other through simple encouraging questions. As a result, our motivation and team spirit remained high throughout the entire process. </p>
                
                
                <p>Overall, even though we only collaborated for the duration of one course, our team highly valued one another. We all learned that a group assignment could be challenging, but with each individual's opinions and efforts, we could overcome any obstacles. We believe that a team progresses further when each member respects and supports one another, enabling personal development every day.</p>
