                            Since An, Triet and Nghia were not familiar with
                            these concepts, it took us at least 1 week to
                            familiarize ourselves with the basic concepts.
                            Fortunately, Phuong is an expert in this field, and
                            being aware of the situation of Phuong's group gave
                            us a way to familiarize ourselves with the new
                            knowledge to avoid difficulties. For example, An
                            would focus on learning how to make a login page,
                            and Nghia and Triet will study a lot about CSS to
                            create a beautiful interface.

               <p>
                 After working with the group, I myself have learned many
                 things and understood more about the members. I believe one of
                 the things we do well is communication. This is one of those
                 rare times when it comes to teamwork, it's a disagreement of
                 opinion, our team respects each other's opinions and when we
                 decide on an issue, we accept it. as well as improve and make
                 it the best. Besides, our team has reasonable working time,
                 which leads to quite effective work performance. However,
                 there are bound to be limitations, I believe one of them is
                 time management. From the beginning, most people wanted to get
                 it done as soon as possible, but when we realized that the
                 deadline had come, we didn't meet the deadline the team set
                 itself. Even so, I firmly believe that this is a good point as
                 it is quite easy to improve. The fact that there was no
                 internal quarrel was quite a surprise for me, but the most
                 surprising thing was that 2 out of 4 members of the group were
                 infected with Covid-19. But despite the limitations on health,
                 the team can still manage and do well in the work they
                 undertake. This has really given me a lot of experience in
                 handling unexpected situations, besides, I believe I have
                 learned a lot about presentation skills, especially the
                 synchronization between speech and actions leading to the
                 delivery of the highest quality content.

               <p>
                 Although I am not an experienced or the oldest member, I have
                 been assigned the role of project manager and developer.
                 Initially, I was surprised by the opportunity to become a
                 project manager. It is indeed a challenging role, but with my
                 own efforts and the support I received, I find this job
                 interesting and meaningful. I started my work by understanding
                 the strengths and weaknesses of each team member through
                 conversations. I always strive to create a dynamic and
                 positive environment where team members are not restricted and
                 can leverage their strengths. As a project manager, I always
                 provide clear task assignments and deadlines for each team
                 member, aiming to ensure that goals are completed on time and
                 not to delay the group's progress. However, I have been too
                 strict in controlling the project, which has made people feel
                 demotivated when working with me. The climax was when two out
                 of four members fell ill during the project. I was shocked
                 when I heard the news, but after calming down, I realized that
                 I should not put too much work pressure on everyone. It would
                 be better if I could balance the work and personal lives of
                 the team members. Additionally, I am also responsible for the
                 development website as a developer. I was extremely surprised
                 that Phuong, despite being a first-year student, had a solid
                 foundation in website design, helping me familiarize myself
                 with new concepts like frontend (FE), backend (BE), and user
                 interface/user experience (UI/UX). After working with the team
                 for a while, I learned that it can be very beneficial to let
                 team members shine in their respective fields. On the other
                 hand, a strict leadership style can sometimes limit creativity
                 and performance. Most importantly, the team becomes strongest
                 when members support and help each other, working together to
                 grow and develop.

               <p>
                 To be able to participate and work on this assignment has been
                 a very valuable learning experience for myself, to be more
                 specific, I was to gain a great deal of knowledge in website
                 development and IT market insights. Over the period of this
                 assignment, we have encountered numerous obstacles such as
                 myself and another team member getting sick because we
                 contracted the Covid-19 virus and busy schedules. But our team
                 was able to overcome these challenges, thanks to An, who took
                 up the role as the project manager, with his ability to
                 quickly respond to sudden development to formulate the
                 appropriate response. However, from my perspective, I believe
                 that there is one shortcoming that we should address which is
                 the project and planning stage. It is likely due to the fact
                 that our team is relatively new to the formal procedure of
                 producing a functioning website so there were some hiccups
                 when it came to the execution process. So for future
                 endeavors, I firmly believe that the correct decision on how
                 we should approach a new and difficult project is to do
                 extensive research on how we should work as a team to tackle
                 the technical aspects of a job. In this project, I was fondly
                 surprised that our team has a very good dynamic when working
                 with each other: everyone accommodates each other's needs,
                 there are rarely any arguments and, if there arise opposing
                 ideas, we always try to find the middle ground that all team
                 members are satisfied with. In the course of working on this
                 assignment with my team, one of the more valuable lessons that
                 I was able to learn was that everyone must play to their
                 strength in order for the group to be successful. As our team
                 leader, An, who was very considerate of everyone, delegated
                 work to us according to our strength and affinity with the
                 task. So even with the mishaps that we have faced along the
                 way, our team was still able to make it out on top of the most
                 challenging situation.

                 Firstly, it was great to say that expectations for team
                 collaboration were met, with responsible and efficient work
                 under time pressure. We communicated effectively and supported
                 each other throughout the project. However, there is still
                 room for improvement. Some members struggled to work on their
                 own and be independent, though this was a minor issue as we
                 continuously reminded and pushed others to do good work. I
                 hope implementing a stricter policy on deadlines and also
                 punishments could address this. Additionally, it took time for
                 some members to familiarize themselves with the required tools
                 like HTML, CSS, and GitHub, so we wish to have better guidance
                 and materials that would streamline the development process
                 better. Surprisingly, specific tasks took longer than
                 expected, directly affecting our timelines and introducing
                 conflicts to external events and other ongoing assignments.
                 Recognizing this, I'll start accounting for potential delays
                 for future projects. This group experience also taught me the
                 importance of recognizing and leveraging individual strengths.
                 Triet's data analysis expertise, An's responsible leadership,
                 and Nghia's hardworking nature were valuable contributions. To
                 sum up, our team has done well considering the pressure and
                 the high expectation of the project. Addressing issues with
                 deadlines, planning for unexpected delays, and providing
                 better documentation and guidance for the basics will help us
                 improve in the long run. On top of that, recognizing and
                 utilizing individual strengths is vital to success.

                 <h4>Group Reflection</h4>
               <p>Overall, throughout the 12 weeks of studying the Essentials of Information Technology course, our team of four members—An, Phuong, Nghia, and Triet—had the opportunity to interact and work effectively together. Initially, we thought that working as a team would be challenging since none of us knew each other before, but we were pleasantly surprised to find that the process went smoothly and all team members collaborated exceptionally well. It can be said that each member was dedicated and enthusiastic about both the group work and the assigned tasks.




                 <p>Our first group assignment arrived early, and since we had limited experience in project execution, each member would read the assignment requirements first and then meet to discuss and determine the project's direction, along with specific responsibilities for each individual. But, this became our working process for the next assignment, with a few changes from online meetings on platforms like messaging apps, and Google Meet, and ultimately decided to conduct our meetings on Teams due to its superior features and the ability to store meeting information. Each member's tasks also changed throughout the assessments, where An initially took on the role of Project Manager, responsible for managing the completion process and deadlines, followed by Phuong as the Technical Leader in order to assist An's role. While each member held a different position and had distinct responsibilities, we always strived to provide feedback and review each other's work. This not only improved the quality of our assignments but also strengthened our bond as a team.</p>
                
                
                <p> In terms of document storage, we utilized Google Drive and Google Docs, while code was done on Visual Studio Code and GitHub. As for communication, we used Facebook Messenger and Team online meeting room as a means of contact. The aforementioned tools undoubtedly contributed significantly to the convenience and effectiveness of group work. Although it cannot be denied that working as a team could be challenging at times, especially when Triet and Nghia faced a fever during tight deadlines, our team always showed understanding and supported each other through simple encouraging questions. As a result, our motivation and team spirit remained high throughout the entire process. </p>
                
                
                <p>Overall, even though we only collaborated for the duration of one course, our team highly valued one another. We all learned that a group assignment could be challenging, but with each individual's opinions and efforts, we could overcome any obstacles. We believe that a team progresses further when each member respects and supports one another, enabling personal development every day.</p>
