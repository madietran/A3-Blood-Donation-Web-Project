Project Description:
Overview:
i) Topic:
Our project, Loving Donors, is an interactive and user-friendly blood donation website. It aims to connect hospital-based organizations and potential blood donors, emphasizing the importance of blood donation and its benefits. 
The website's home page provides comprehensive information about the donation process, eligibility requirements, and health considerations. It simplifies the registration process with an easy-to-use form, allowing donors to input personal information and update it as needed.
Key features of the website include blood donation scheduling, enabling donors to book appointments online and manage them flexibly. It also helps donors find the nearest donation facility based on their location. After each donation, the website assesses the donor's health and provides examination results for monitoring purposes. This helps hospitals manage their blood supply efficiently and plan future campaigns. Donors can track their donation history and milestones, fostering engagement.
Data analysis features to collect and analyze demographic and donation information, helping hospitals assess campaign efficiency and manage blood sources effectively. The website integrates with social media, sharing inspiring donor stories to encourage visitors. Contact information and support features are provided for donor inquiries.
Overall, our project aims to promote blood donation, raise awareness, and provide a user-friendly platform for donors. By optimizing the donation process and utilizing data analysis, we aim to increase donation rates, optimize blood resources, and save lives.
ii) Motivation:
The motivation behind our group's website project is based on the desire of its members to create positive value for the community, along with contributing their own blood donation experience to build the website. The "Loving Donors" project is an interactive blood donation website aimed at connecting potential blood donors with hospitals and organizations. Our website will focus on three main goals: optimizing the blood donation process, personalizing the user interface, and analyzing data on the number of blood donors to control the blood supply in each area. Additionally, we include certain contemporary IT trends in our solution, such as predictive analysis based on statistical and machine learning models. Reviewing from our previous report submission for "The IT World", instead of using Excel for data analysis, our team will be adopting RStudio to carry out the necessary steps of data transformation, visualization, and analysis. Through integrating the R analysis programming language, with the proper set up, we will be able to automate the analysis and visualization processes for the website. Regarding the location function, we will use web-based mapping services such as Google Maps directly on the website with built-in databases and distance calculation. The service allows users to enter their current location and find the nearest blood bank. Finally, we believe that this website will be a useful tool not only in increasing convenience for blood donors but also in helping hospitals effectively manage their blood supply. Creating a website can showcase a wide range of skills such as web development, user experience design, problem-solving, project management, data analysis, reporting, and collaboration. It also highlights important soft skills like teamwork, creativity, innovation, and a dedication to making a positive social impact. With all these skills on display, our team is confident that the website will be an attractive candidate to employers.
iii) Landscape:
After deciding to make a website about blood donation, we found that we would face a lot of strong opponents like NHS Blood Donation - United Kingdom (https://www.blood.co.uk/), South African National Blood Service (https://sanbs.org.za/) and New Zealand Blood Service (https://www.nzblood.co.nz/). The NHS Blood Donation website, operated by the National Health Service of the UK, serves as the official platform for blood donation information, eligibility requirements, and the donation process. Similarly, the South African National Blood Service website and the New Zealand Blood Service website offer comparable resources, including appointment scheduling and information about blood drives. These websites aim to connect potential donors and facilitate the donation process by providing comprehensive information and convenient appointment booking. After analyzing the competitor's strengths, we believe these will be the 3 strengths of the website: optimizing the blood donation process, personalizing the user interface, and analyzing data on the number of blood donors to control the blood supply in each area. Our primary focus is streamlining the registration process for blood donation. We are implementing an intuitive form that allows donors to easily enter and update their personal information, aiming to optimize the overall blood donation process. In terms of user interface personalization, we will emphasize user interaction and friendliness to provide the optimal experience when registering, booking appointments and tracking their donation history. Last but not least, what sets our team's project apart from others in the market is the incorporation of data analytics features. This addition allows them to analyze and leverage data effectively, giving us a competitive edge. This data is valuable for evaluating hospital campaign effectiveness to identify trends and manage blood resources more effectively.

Group reflection:
An - s3959931
Although I am not an experienced or the oldest member, I have been assigned the role of project manager and developer. Initially, I was surprised by the opportunity to become a project manager. It is indeed a challenging role, but with my own efforts and the support I received, I find this job interesting and meaningful. I started my work by understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each team member through conversations. I always strive to create a dynamic and positive environment where team members are not restricted and can leverage their strengths. As a project manager, I always provide clear task assignments and deadlines for each team member, aiming to ensure that goals are completed on time and not to delay the group's progress. However, I have been too strict in controlling the project, which has made people feel demotivated when working with me. The climax was when two out of four members fell ill during the project. I was shocked when I heard the news, but after calming down, I realized that I should not put too much work pressure on everyone. It would be better if I could balance the work and personal lives of the team members. Additionally, I am also responsible for the development website as a developer. I was extremely surprised that Phuong, despite being a first-year student, had a solid foundation in website design, helping me familiarize myself with new concepts like frontend (FE), backend (BE), and user interface/user experience (UI/UX). After working with the team for a while, I learned that it can be very beneficial to let team members shine in their respective fields. On the other hand, a strict leadership style can sometimes limit creativity and performance. Most importantly, the team becomes strongest when members support and help each other, working together to grow and develop.
